1. Dockerizing the Wisecow Application

Dockerfile: A Dockerfile defines the environment and instructions for building the Docker image for your application. Here’s a generic template for a Node.js app (assuming Wisecow is built with Node.js, but you should adjust according to the actual stack used by Wisecow):

# Use the official Node.js image from Docker Hub
FROM node:16-alpine

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the application’s package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the entire application into the container
COPY . .

# Expose the port that the application will run on
EXPOSE 3000

# Define the command to run your application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
